# TicTacToe-game
<br>
My Java-based version of the traditional strategy game Tic Tac Toe is a stylish and engaging experience. Using a user-friendly interface, two players can alternately place their "X" or "O" markers on the board using a 3x3 grid that the programme uses. The application of object-oriented design concepts in the game improves readability and code modularity. The graphical user interface offers an eye-catching interface, directing players through every action and guarding against incorrect inputs. Effective algorithms make sure that every game has a fair outcome by looking for winning conditions. The project provides a fun gaming experience and can also be used as a helpful instructional resource for Java lovers who want to learn more about game creation because of its clear and well-commented code.
